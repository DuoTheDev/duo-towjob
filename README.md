take out the npc aspect of the job

make it so that police can request a tow pick up

make a marker for the request?

have similar towing mechanics

have a system though that allows the tow company to have the car within the impound system for a certain time (depends on crime / reason it was towed)

after that time is up, the car owner can then get the car out

maybe add preset config values for reasons for towing / impound times
